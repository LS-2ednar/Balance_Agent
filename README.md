# Balance_Agent
First AI Agent Project

Goal of this Project is to learn more about multi file and directory python projects, using Google's Gemini API and python-dotenv libraries. 

From a Concept point of view it is enabeling the LLM to create and execute code within a confined location (directory) within the projects scope.
 
A depiction of the Chatbot control looks like this:

Directory--> <-- Bot (Execute Code) 

The Code to execute is generated using Google's Gemini Model.

Another fun fact is that this project has several "security" relevant topics:
- API Key Management
- Creating Files automatically
- Generating Code automatically
- Executing Code automatically

Therefore proper safety mesures needed to be put in place
